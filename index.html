  <h1>About Lisa Draho</h1>
  <p>Lisa Draho is an emerging filmmaker pursuing an MFA in Integrated Media Arts at Hunter College in New York City. Drawn to quiet subject matter that warrants a closer look, Lisaâ€™s films invite the viewer to experience a new way of seeing and knowing.

Lisa earned a Masters in Communication from the University of Minnesota and a B.A. in English and Film from the University of Manitoba. Born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Lisa has lived in Brooklyn, NY for 25 years (and counting). She is married and has two daughters and three cats.
